# UIndy-CSCI155-2018-II
Class examples from UIndy CSCI 155, Winter 2018

To compile and run these programs, you can double-click the file to open it,
then click the green 'Run' button above.  Be sure the extension is .cc so it
is compiled correctly.

Alternatively you can compile and run from the bash terminal:
````
$ gcc filename.cc
$ ./a.out
```

By default gcc will compile the program, and if no errors are found, produce an
executable called a.out.  Since the computer isn't used to running programs
located in the current directory, you must run with with a ./ prefix:
```
$ ./a.out
```

All class examples will be posted to this github repository.  To get an updated
version of all files, on the command line type:
```
$ git pull  
```

We will go over basic Unix commands in class!
